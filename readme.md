# RFM96W-REPL

The RFM96W is a low-cost LoRa radio transceiver from Adafruit. This package
provides an REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) interface via an Arudino and the
RFM96W for remotely controlling systems.

This package is part of the software library created and maintained by the Norco
College Rocket Project. Made with ♥️ from Horsetown USA.
 
## Setup

This library uses a copy of the RadioHead library provided by Adafruit. The 
library can be found in the `lib/` folder and can be directly imported into
the Arudino IDE.
